    "Detailed explanation:\n",
    "    \n",
    "The function `connected` determines if two nodes, `node1` and `node2`, are connected in a graph `g`. The function employs a `Depth-First Search (DFS)` approach to traverse the graph, which is a common technique for exploring the entirety of a graph or searching for specific elements within it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **The function `connected` takes five parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `g`: The graph in which to check connectivity, assumed to be an instance of a `networkx` graph.\n",
    "  - `node1` and `node2`: The nodes between which connectivity is to be checked. These can be any hashable types typically used as graph nodes (like strings or integers).\n",
    "  - `visited`: A set that tracks the nodes that have been visited during the DFS. It defaults to `None` if not provided.\n",
    "  - `verbose`: A boolean flag that, when set to `True`, enables the printing of debug statements about the function's progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization of `visited` Set**: This part of the code initializes the `visited` set with `node1` if no `visited` set has been passed to the function. This is crucial to prevent the function from revisiting the same nodes, which can lead to infinite recursion or redundant operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base Case for Recursion**: If `node1` is the same as `node2`, the function returns `True` immediately, indicating that a node is trivially connected to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DFS Traversal**: This loop iterates through each neighbor `v` of `node1`. If `v` has already been visited, it skips to the next neighbor. Otherwise, it adds `v` to the `visited` set and, if `verbose` is `True`, prints the current node. It then makes a recursive call to `connected` to check if there is a path from `v` to `node2`. If such a path exists (`connected(g, v, node2, visited, verbose)` returns `True`), the function immediately returns `True`, signaling that `node1` and `node2` are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Verbose Output for Unsuccessful Search**: If no connection is found after exploring all neighbors, and if `verbose` is `True`, the function prints a message indicating that it could not find a path from `node1` to `node2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Return Value**: If the function exits the loop without having returned `True`, it returns `False`, indicating that no path exists between `node1` and `node2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method of traversal ensures that the function thoroughly explores all possible paths between `node1` and `node2` in the graph. The `visited` set is crucial to avoid cycles and redundant checks, making the function efficient in terms of avoiding unnecessary work. The optional `verbose` parameter allows for detailed debugging."
